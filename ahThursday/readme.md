# Data Structures

Copy the `main.js` file into your workspace. Try to complete at least **parts 1 and 2** (up to line 113 in the file as it's currently written). There are 7 parts in total - feel free to keep going!

## Bonus

Use some of the DOM manipulation skills you learned today to upgrade your rock paper scissors game from yesterday. Move the game play out of the console and into the light!

## Bonuser

Work on the [JS Objects lab](../15_javascripts_objects_lab)!

## More?
